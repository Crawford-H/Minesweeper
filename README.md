# Minesweeper-in-C++

About
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a small project I started in first year in 2019 after learning C++.  Over the past few years I have updated and redone the code to make it cleaner and more readable. I used the olcPixelGameEngine as I only needed something lightweight and quick.


The master branch is very basic as I wanted to keep the code clean.  The experimental branch is more feature rich containing things that the master lacks such as a menu, timer, and game over screens.
