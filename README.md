# Minesweeper-in-C++

About
----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a small project I started in first year in 2019 after learning C++.  Over the past few years I have updated and redone the code to make it cleaner and more readable. I used the olcPixelGameEngine as I only needed something lightweight and quick.

Versions
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The master branch is very basic as I wanted to keep the code clean.  The experimental branch is more feature rich containing things that the master lacks such as a menu, timer, and game over screens.

The master version plays like a classic game of Minesweeper. Allowing you to flag and dig tiles with a mouse.  A number of tiles contain a bomb which are randomly placed, so you can't just 
memorize locations of the bombs.  The master version doesn't check for if a game is won or lost.
